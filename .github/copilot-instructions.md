# Copilot Instructions for corebox_build

## Project Overview
- **corebox_build** is the core CRM backend for Corebox Systems.
- The main code is expected in the `backend/` directory (currently empty).
- Python virtual environment is managed in `.venv/`.

## Architecture & Structure
- The project is in early stages; main backend logic will reside in `backend/`.
- No code or modules are present yet; expect future Python backend development.
- The root `README.md` is minimal and should be updated as the project evolves.

## Developer Workflows
- Activate the Python virtual environment before development:
  - Windows PowerShell: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- No build, test, or run scripts are present yet.
- Add and document any new workflows in this file as the project grows.

## Conventions & Patterns
- Follow standard Python project structure and best practices.
- Place all backend code in the `backend/` directory.
- Use the `.venv/` for all Python dependencies.

## Integration & Dependencies
- No external dependencies or integrations are defined yet.
- Update this file with integration details as they are added.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If adding new components, create subfolders in `backend/` by feature or service.
- Document any new conventions or workflows in this file.
- Reference this file and `README.md` for project context.
